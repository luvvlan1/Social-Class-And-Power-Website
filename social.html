    <h1> ------------------------------</h1> 
    <h1 class="h1"><li>Social Classes </li> </h1>

    <p> The Pogues demonstrate loyalty, resourcefulness, and resilience despite their circumstances. Their struggles foster strong friendships, trust, and a deep sense of community—qualities often overlooked in competitive, wealth-driven societies.
      <br>
      <br>
      However, the Kooks’ desire to maintain power at all costs leads to manipulation, greed, and even violence. Ward Cameron, for example, prioritizes wealth over morality, making selfish decisions with devastating consequences. </p> 

    <h1> ------------------------------ </h1>

    <h1 class="h1"><li>Some More Info</li> </h1>
    <p> Throughout the show, characters operate in morally gray areas, where the distinction between good and bad is blurred.
      <br>
      <br>
      The Pogues break laws, steal, and lie—not out of greed but as a means of survival or to expose the truth (e.g., John B’s search for his father and the gold).
      <br>
      <br>
      The Kooks, despite having resources, often act out of selfishness and entitlement (e.g., Ward Cameron framing John B).
    <h1> ------------------------------ </h1>

    <h1 class="h1"><li> Social Outcomes:</li></h1>
    <p> Good: The show suggests that morality is tied to intent and circumstance. The Pogues’ “bad” actions are often justifiable because they challenge a corrupt system. Their fight for justice can inspire audiences to question societal norms and inequality.
      <br>
      <br>
      Bad: The Kooks’ immoral actions showcase the darker side of privilege, where power can lead to exploitation and harm.
      <br>
      <br>
      Neutral: Characters like Rafe Cameron, though antagonistic, show how toxic environments and privilege can shape destructive behaviors. This nuanced portrayal humanizes his struggles but doesn’t excuse them.</p>
  
    
    <h1> ------------------------------ </h1>
   
    <h1 class="h1">The Struggle for Identity and Belonging</h1>
    
    The search for treasure is more than just a quest for gold—it symbolizes the characters’ search for identity, purpose, and belonging.
    For John B, the treasure hunt represents his father’s legacy and the validation of his family’s struggles.
    <br>
    For Cleo and other Pogues, it’s about finding a place where they are accepted and valued.
    For the Kooks, power and wealth often define their identities, leaving them emotionally unfulfilled and morally lost.
    <br>
    
    <h3 class="h3"> Social Outcomes</h3>
    Good: The Pogues’ sense of belonging highlights the importance of community over material wealth. They find happiness and purpose in their friendships.
    Bad: The Kooks’ obsession with wealth shows how chasing material success can erode genuine connections and moral clarity.
    Neutral: Characters like Sarah Cameron and Pope navigate both worlds, showing that identity is fluid and shaped by choices rather than circumstances.
