<p> The big social main idea of Outer Banks revolves around class divisions, loyalty, and the pursuit of identity and belonging. At its core, the show highlights the stark contrasts between two social classes: the wealthy "Kooks" and the working-class "Pogues." These divisions are not just economic but also cultural, as the characters' interactions and struggles reflect broader themes of privilege, social mobility, and identity.

The show delves deeply into the relationships between friends, family, and romantic partners, with loyalty being a central theme. The main characters—specifically John B. and his friends—navigate these social divides, constantly fighting against the odds in search of a treasure that promises to change their lives, while also confronting deeper questions about what it means to belong and to fight for your values.

Ultimately, Outer Banks can be seen as a commentary on the power dynamics between different social classes, the sacrifices made for loyalty, and the drive for a better life. It also explores themes of friendship, love, and the desire for freedom, all set against the backdrop of a high-stakes treasure hunt that reveals how far people are willing to go to achieve their dreams and break free from their circumstances.</p>
